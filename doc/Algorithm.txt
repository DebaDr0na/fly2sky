The object is to define the working of the drone, whico form now on will be refreed as Fs2.

Fs2 is a bi-copter (VTOL), having 2 BLDC motor mounted on top of 2 Servo.
The device will be powered by a 3s(12V) battery and will have 5V 2A and 3.3V 1A power line.
2 ESC will control the respective motors.Fs2 will have 9 axis DOF IMU(9250),
barometer(BMP180), microcontroller (Pi Pico) with built in temperature sensor, NRF240L for
radio communication.

Additional flight computer will be there to program the flight controller easily, 
and provide realtime visual feed back at time of flight.

Ground control(to be refered as controller) will be a radio tranceiver, having two 2-axis potentiometer 
commonly known as joystick and 6 push buttons.

Working Algorithm:

1. Drone States: OFF,ON,Armed,Active,Hover,Landing,config == 0,1,2,3,4,5,6
2. STATE OFF - Low-Power Radio on.
3. Controller button sequence will transition state.
4. STATE ON - Pico will get and stream steady signals from sensors and
flight computer
5. Controller button sequence will transition state.
6. STATE Armed - Motor will start rotating till the net G reduced to certain [VALUE]
7. [TAKEOFF] sequence / Throttle UP joystick will transition to ACTIVE.
8. STATE Active - PID control will be active, Joystick sensitity can be adjusted by
non-linear function. 
9. STATE Hover - It can enter/exit from/to Active state only.When no drive input is recived 
from controller it will enter into this mode.It will automatically disengage 
when any controller dive input is recieved.
10. STATE Landing - It will slowly decent, the speed will vary depending on the heigt,
gradually decerasing as it reaches close to ground level eventually transitioning to Armed
and ON state.This state can disengaged by force Controller input.
